    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>
        Web development is the art and science of creating websites and web applications. As a web developer, you’ll be responsible for building and maintaining everything people see and interact with in their browsers. This field offers a high demand for talent, flexibility in career paths, and endless opportunities for growth.
    </p>

    <h3>🔑 Key Concepts to Learn First</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> The backbone of web pages. HTML defines the structure — like headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. It's like the skeleton of your website.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> Adds style to your HTML. With CSS, you control colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. Think of it as the design layer.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A programming language used to add interactivity. It powers dynamic content like dropdowns, sliders, form validation, and even games!</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Dev Tools:</strong> Every browser (like Chrome) has built-in tools to inspect and debug websites. Learning to use these is crucial for testing and fixing your code.</li>
    </ul>
